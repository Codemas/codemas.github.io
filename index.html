	<center><h2>About</h2></center>
	<justify><p>Codemas is an accelerated coding camp to help inspire and prepare children to innovate in the world of technology. As college students ourselves, we understand the necessity of Computer Science education in today's world. Children are starting younger and younger in order to catch up to today's requirements. After researching into many programs offered in the area, we were unable to find a program that would easily inspire children. Children generally do not like to be taught by authority; they'd rather be taught by friends. And that's where we come in!</p>
	<p>We are offering two different programs this winter (listed below) aimed at different age grounps, but anyone is welcome to enroll in either. We would be providing light snacks, and engaging the children in fun-filled yet educational activities.</p></justify>
